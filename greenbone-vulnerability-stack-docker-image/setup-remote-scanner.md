# Setup Remote Scanner

1. Create the main GVM container with the ssh server enabled and the ssh port published: \(replace {version} with the version you want\)

   ```text
   docker run --detach --publish 8080:9392 --publish 2222:22 --env SSHD="true" --env PASSWORD="Your admin password here" --volume gvm-data:/data --name gvm securecompliance/gvm:{version}
   ```

2. Wait for the GVM container to fully start before continuing
3. Create a scanner scanner container on the system you want to scan from:

   ```text
   docker run --detach --volume scanner:/data --env MASTER_ADDRESS={IP or Hostname of GVM container} --env MASTER_PORT=2222 --name scanner securecompliance/gvm:scanner-{version}
   ```

4. If the remote scanner and the GVM container are on different networks then make sure the the scanner container can reach the ssh port on the GVM container
5. After the scanner container fully starts check the logs for the "Scanner id" and "Public key"
6. Now back on the host with the GVM container run the following command and enter a name for the scanner, the "Scanner id", and "Public key" from the scanner

   ```text
   docker exec -it gvm /add-scanner.sh
   ```

7. now if you login to the GVM container web interface and go to "Configuration -&gt; Scanners" you should see the scanner you just added listed
