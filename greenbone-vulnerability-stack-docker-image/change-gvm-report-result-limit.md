# Change GVM report result limit

Currently the GVM reporting does not allow you to export reports containing more than 1000 lines. This is true for all report types. We have found a way around this limitation; however, it creates a problem with the webUI and the vulnerability data will take longer to load in the browser the higher you set the max rows. We have created a script that will allow you to set a custom rows per page value based on the size of your scan results. We have found that it isn't worth the hassle to try exporting reports with more than 15000 lines. 15000 seems to be the sweet spot that will usually work, provided you have enough RAM in the device used to access the web UI.

To implement this fix, run the following command AFTER you finished the rest of the setup.

```text
docker exec -it gvm bash -exec "/reportFix.sh"
```

Note: we have used the container name gvm to be consistent with the rest of the documentation. Modify the command accordingly.
