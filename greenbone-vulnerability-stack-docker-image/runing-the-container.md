# Runing the container

This command will pull, create, and start the container: \(replace {version} with the version you want\)

```text
docker run --detach --publish 8080:9392 --env PASSWORD="Your admin password here" --volume gvm-data:/data --name gvm securecompliance/gvm:{v
```

You can use whatever `--name` you'd like but for the sake of this guide we're using gvm.

The `-p 8080:9392` switch will port forward `8080` on the host to `9392` \(the container web interface port\) in the docker container. Port `8080` was chosen only to avoid conflicts with any existing OpenVAS/GVM installation. You can change `8080` to any available port that you'd like.

Depending on your hardware, it can take anywhere from a few seconds to 10+ minutes while the NVTs are scanned and the database is rebuilt. **The default admin user account is created after this process has completed. If you are unable to access the web interface, it means it is still loading \(be patient\).**
