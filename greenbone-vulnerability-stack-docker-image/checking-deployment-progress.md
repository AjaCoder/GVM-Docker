# Checking Deployment Progress

There is no easy way to estimate the remaining NVT loading time, but you can check if the NVTs have finished loading by running:

```text
docker logs gvm
```

If you see "Your GVM 11 container is now ready to use!" then, you guessed it, your container is ready to use.
