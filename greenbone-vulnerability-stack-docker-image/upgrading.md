# Upgrading

If you are upgrading from an older version of postgresql than the one you want to upgrade to. You will need to first upgrade the postgres database.

Before upgrading the database make sure the gvm container is stopped.

You can upgrade the database with this command:

```text
docker run --tty --rm --volume gvm-data:/data --name temp securecompliance/gvm:upgrade-database
```

or

```text
docker run --tty --rm --volume /docker/apps/gvm/storage/data:/data --name upgrade-database-temp securecompliance/gvm:upgrade-database
```

After upgrading the database or if you did not need to upgrade continue below.

Remove the old container with:

```text
docker rm -f gvm
```

Create a new container with this command replacing {version} with the version you want:

```text
docker run --detach --publish 8080:9392 --env PASSWORD="Your admin password here" --volume gvm-data:/data --name gvm securecompliance/gvm:{version}
```
