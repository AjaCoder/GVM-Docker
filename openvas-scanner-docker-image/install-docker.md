# Install Docker

If you have a Debian-Based Operating System you can use the docker.io package.

```text
apt install docker.io
```

or

You can use this script in the repo

```text
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Secure-Compliance-Solutions-LLC/GVM-Docker/master/install-docker.sh
sudo bash ./install-docker.sh
```

> If you are using a docker supported OS that does not have the docker.io package, you should take a look at [this page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

You can also use the docker install script by running:

```text
curl https://get.docker.com | sh
```
